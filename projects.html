				This is a 2d platformer shooter game implemented using sfml (simple fast multimedia library). The goal of the game is 
				pretty much to kill all enemies which are alien-like creatures that have the options of either jumping, shooting a projectile, or
				moving left or right.It has platformer collision detection(platforms and blocks) and has multiple types of weapons (eg. guns, snipers, rocket launchers , grenades , and a healing staff).Each of which has its own benefits and the healing staff heals everyone in the camera range and not only the player.
